## Camera

You can use the camera function on your phone. Using React Native Image Picker, this app will ask for permissions first and then run the camera. You can take a photo and see the result in the frame.

Despite not having an interesting function, it was implemented just to know some of the functionalities that react native provides. This screen can be improved with a little more time.
